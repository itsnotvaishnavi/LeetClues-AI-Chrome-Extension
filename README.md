# 🚀 LeetClues — AI-Powered Progressive Coding Hint Extension

LeetClues is a Chrome extension that provides progressive AI-generated hints for LeetCode problems without revealing full solutions.  
The extension uses a Node.js backend integrated with the Groq LLM API to generate contextual hints in real-time.
